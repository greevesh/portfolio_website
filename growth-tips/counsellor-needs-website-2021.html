          <p class="date"><b>1. Jan, 2021</b></p>
          
<p> Our lives have been entirely changed in the year 2020 because of COVID-19, and this deadly virus took no time in spreading throughout the entire world in just a short amount of time. </p>
<p>The virus stole many things from us, including the peace of many people whose only escape from their problems was to distract themselves by going to work or school, but all of this has since changed. </p>
<p>Although many jobs and school classes have migrated online, for many, escaping from mental health issues has become barely possible.</p>
<p>The events of this year have increased depression and anxiety amongst people on a wide scale. </p>
<p>And because of how widespread this disease has become, setting up a website for almost every business has become essential. </p>
<p>A counselling website contains all the information about you.</p>
<p>It is your resume, portfolio, accomplishments, and education. </p>
<p>Most importantly, it is your sales funnel.</p>
<p>Your counselling website is what guides your visitors into seeking your help and purchasing your services. </p>
<h2>1. COVID-19</h2>
<img src="/images/blog/covid-19-masks-min.jpg" alt="covid-19-masks" class="img-fluid">
<p> You guessed it.</p>
<p>The first and the most important reason as to why someone should consider setting up a private counselling practice is the presence of COVID-19 in our lives and because of how fatal this virus is. </p>
<p>To state the obvious, anxiety, depression and other forms of stress are on the rise. </p>
<p>Public health actions, such as social isolation, can cause people to feel lonely and deserted, ultimately increasing fear and anxiety. </p>
<p> Not to mention the escalation of familial abuse cases that were already taking place before the widespread of COVID-19.</p>
<p> As we all know how contagious COVID-19 is, having a website becomes more than just convenient for the counsellor and client. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s potentially a life-saver in terms of its ability to keep people indoors. </p>
<p>Speaking as a web-designer, this must sound like a self-serving thing to say, but choosing to focus more on growing your private practice online is a moral obligation at this point in time.</p>
<p>This year has increased depression and anxiety amongst people on a wide scale. </p>
<p>Due to the inability or moral obligation to stay indoors, acquiring a website is an ideal option for almost every counsellor, therapist, psychologist or any other mental health professional. </p>
<p>Growing your private practice online by having a website benefits everyone. </p>
<h2>2. Marketing</h2>
<p> Many counsellors and therapists forget (especially ones from older generations!) that an increasing amount of people are searching and surfing the internet instead of the more typical phone book when they search for a therapist. </p>
<p>People around the globe have access to the internet on the go; due to the increase in the technology of mobile devices, the internet has become the fastest and yet the most convenient way for people to find precisely what they are searching for. </p>
<p>If you want to set up a private practice and want it to grow, you need to find clients interested in your methods, and for that, you need your very own counselling website.</p>
<p> It becomes very easy to let your character shine through a website by setting up a private counselling practice. </p>
<p> Not only do potential clients want to know just what you do, but they want to know how you do it. </p>
<p>They&rsquo;ll want to get to know you as a counsellor or therapist, and a counselling website aids in the trust-building process.</p>
<p>Again, as I don&rsquo;t need to tell you, possible clients desire to seek help from a counsellor they feel they know, like, and trust. </p>
<p>Through your counselling practice website, the clients should feel that they already know and like you from surfing your website. </p>
<p>Along with all the necessary information, you should also add a headshot photo so people can put a face to the name and some character to the content you post to make you seem more human.</p>
<p> For the growth of your private counselling practice, it&rsquo;s also necessary to mention what you specialize in and the methods you use to provide that speciality. </p>
<p> After conducting some of my own SEO research, I found that people with mental health issues often make pretty specific Google searches:</p>
<img class="keyword-specific-img" src="/images/blog/counsellor-for-anxiety-keyword-min.png" alt="counsellor-for-anxiety-keyword" class="img-fluid">
<img class="keyword-specific-img" src="/images/blog/counsellor-for-child-keyword-min.png" alt="counsellor-for-child-keyword" class="img-fluid">
<img class="keyword-specific-img" src="/images/blog/counsellor-for-depression-keyword-min.png" alt="counsellor-for-depression-keyword" class="img-fluid">
<img class="keyword-specific-img" src="/images/blog/counsellor-for-students-keyword-min.png" alt="counsellor-for-students-keyword" class="img-fluid">
<img class="keyword-specific-img" src="/images/blog/counsellor-for-teenager-keyword-min.png" alt="counsellor-for-teenager-keyword" class="img-fluid">
<span class="text-muted">These words may have a lower volume of searches but their 'SD' (SEO difficulty) is low. This means they are easier for your counselling website to rank for when people search for these terms.</span>
<p>The keywords &lsquo;counsellor&rsquo; and &lsquo;therapist&rsquo; do get more searches but are far more competitive:</p>
<img class="keyword-brief-img" src="/images/blog/counsellor-keyword-min.png" alt="counsellor-keyword" class="img-fluid">
<div class="text-center"><span class="text-muted">Notice the volume and SD scores.</span></div>
<p> Which means you have less chance of appearing at the top of page 1 if people search for these terms. </p>
<p>So, just labelling yourself as a &lsquo;counsellor&rsquo; or &lsquo;therapist&rsquo; may not be the best strategy. </p>
<p>Starting your very own counselling business website and sharing your website&rsquo;s articles on how you deal with common mental health issues is a great way of educating and growing a loyal client base.</p>
<p>In turn, this will help your private practice grow.</p>
<h2>3. Time Management</h2>
<p> Time is money, and you are worth so much. </p>
<p> Not only will a counselling website save potential clients time by having all of your information in one place, but it will also save you time because it covers all the preliminary queries a client may have before their first session. </p>
<p>An FAQ section on your counselling website is great for this:</p>
<img src="/images/blog/faq-example-therapist-min.png" alt="faq-example-therapist" class="img-fluid">
<p>Your website speaks for you, rather than having to respond to initial calls, emails, or messages.</p>
<p> By setting up a private counselling practice website with a prominent contact form or a booking process, your practice will be open for business 24/7, even when you&rsquo;re not around, making it convenient for your potential clients all across the UK: </p>
<img src="/images/blog/therapist-contact-form-example-min.png" alt="therapist-contact-form-example" class="img-fluid">
<h2>4. Credibility and Referrals</h2>
<p>As the internet has become the go-to place for most people seeking any type of service, a counselling website for your practice is exactly what you need to help establish your credibility and status as a counsellor or therapist. </p>
<p>People who use the internet widely may place more faith in a provider who has a well-developed website. </p>
<p>Suppose a person looking for a counsellor can only find your name and phone number. </p>
<p>In that case, they may pass you over in favour of a professional with a website offering more detailed information. </p>
<p>If you choose to build a website for your practice, put in enough effort to make it a quality one. </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not confident you can create a good enough counselling or therapy website, consider reaching out to someone with more knowledge. </p>
<p>Some web designers might charge high fees, but having a website is an investment, not an expense. </p>
<p>You may think some web designers charge high but ask yourself this, how much money and extra clients will a &pound;1000 website make me? </p>
<p>The answer is, over the course of a full year, probably a lot more than a £1000.</p>
<p>The more professional your counselling website looks, the more professional you will look. The more sales-optimized the website is, the more clients you will get and the more money you will make. </p>
<p>Having a bad website will reduce your likelihood of gaining credibility and referrals, it&rsquo;d be better not to have one at all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, having a good one will do quite the opposite.</p>
<h2>5. Blogging</h2>
<p>Blogging is a very effective way to grow a private counselling practice as it enables you to showcase your expertise and sell your services through your articles. </p>
<p>For example, you can share stories and little tips and tricks to get past the stress and anxiety an average person feels daily:</p>
<img src="/images/blog/therapy-blog-example-min.png" alt="therapy-blog-example" class="img-fluid">
<div class="text-center"><span class="text-muted">Just one example from <a href="https://www.goodtherapy.org/blog/">GoodTherapy</a>.</span></div>
<p>As long as the information is useful or relatable, blogging can really help people. </p>
<p>People are much more likely to read content like this now, given the current circumstances.</p>
<p>If someone actually benefits from what you write this could lead them into being a possible client that could help you grow your counselling practice. </p>
<p>Your blog would contain and provide treasured information that potential clients would want to know. </p>
<p>You are already skilled, and now you just have to blog about your skills to gather people's attention by writing informative articles. </p>
<p>Your counselling practice blog will elevate your ability to reach others through keywords and prearranged data that helps in the growth of your online counselling practice. </p>
<p>Small businesses that blog get <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/5014/study-shows-business-blogging-leads-to-55-more-website-visitors.aspx">55% more website traffic</a> than those that don't. This number gradually goes up depending on how much you post and the content quality of each post.</p>
<p>Your blog should cover subjects linked to your objectives and your spectators, and your blog is less about you and more about the services you can offer as a professional counsellor. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all about your audience and their needs. </p>
<p>The growth of your counselling practice depends on the quality and quantity of what you write. </p>
<p>The more you write, the more queries you answer. </p>
<p>Answering queries will get you more leads that can be turned into sales.</p>
<p>The more you comfort them, the more expected they are to become your clients because as you write, you relate to them, which again brings the know, like, and trust factor. </p>
<p>They get to know you as you write to them and ultimately develop a trusting relationship. </p>
<p>This is key to making a sale in any domain, especially the mental health industry.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you have the budget and you want to get more clients, getting a website built as a counsellor or therapist is a no-brainer. </p>
<p>However, the kind of website you get does matter. </p>
<p>Websites that aren&rsquo;t designed correctly will not only turn away users but Google too.</p>
<p>Having a professional and pretty website will take you far. </p>
<p>But having a professional, pretty and <b>sales-based</b> counsellor website will take you so much further. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, the number one priority of a website should be to convert users into sales.</p>
<p>This is what sales-based websites do. </p>
<p>These are what I create.</p>
