         <h2>Hi, I'm Harrison Greeves</h2>

         <br>

         <div class="profile-pic-container">
          <img class="profile-pic" src="/images/main/harrison-greeves-profile-picture-cartoon.png" alt="harrison-greeves-profile-picture-cartoon">
         </div>

         <br><br>

         <p>It's my mission to help counsellors (and other mental health specialists) get more clients by growing their business online.</p>
         
         <br>

         <p>How do I do this, you ask?</p>
         
         <br>

         <p>The three key services I provide are:</p>
         
         <br>

         <ul>
            <li><a href="#web-design">Web Design/Development</a></li>
            <li><a href="#seo">SEO</a></li>
            <li><a href="#social-media">Social Media Management</a></li>
         </ul>

         <br>

         <h3 id="web-design">Web Design/Development</h3>

         <br>

         <p>For any business to succeed online, no matter the domain. <a href="growth-tips/counsellor-needs-website.html">They <b>must</b> have a website at the very least.</a> The two other services I offer (<a href="growth-tips/counsellors-need-seo-services.html">SEO</a> and social media management) are highly valuable and absolutely will help you get more clients.</p>

         <br>

         <p>However, for any of those services to work properly, you're going to want to have a website. It's that simple.</p>
         
         <br>
         
         <p>Your website is your main sales funnel and your online business bedrock. Online marketing without a website is like driving a boat with a giant hole at the bottom of it.</p>

         <br>

         <p>"Great. But anyone can build a website, right? There are tons of website builders I can use to create one myself? Why fork out my hard-earned cash to pay you to do something that I can already do?"</p>

         <br>

         <p>That's a fair and reasonable question. It's also correct. Pretty much any computer-literate person can build a website these days.</p>

         <br>

         <p>But not everyone can build effective websites...</p>
         
         <br>
             
         <p>What do I mean by that?</p>

         <br>
         
         <p>Without sounding too brash, I believe this is one of the ways that separate me from your average web designer.</p>

         <br>

         <p>Web designers and people, in general, tend to treat websites more like status symbols and tools of association for their business.</p>

         <br>

         <p>They put all the emphasis on design (which is important) and much less focus on guiding the user to purchase your offering.</p>

         <br>
         
         <p>It is true, having a website does make your business look more trustworthy and professional.</p>

         <br>

         <p>But the number one priority should be that they are designed in a way that gets the user to purchase whatever product or service the business is selling.</p>

         <br>

         <p>Because at the end of the day. What good is a pretty website that isn't converting users into sales?</p>

         <br>

         <p>At that point, hiring a web designer becomes an expense and not an investment.</p>

         <br>

         <p>That's why I build <b>conversion-oriented</b> websites. Websites that focus on the goals of the business (e.g. more appointments, more email subscribers, or more traffic).</p>

         <br>

         <p>Websites that guide the user in purchasing your service.</p>

         <br>

         <p>Already have a website?</p>
         
         <br>
         
         <p><a href="/#free-website-analysis">Get my free website analysis PDF document</a>.</p>

         <br>

         <h3 id="seo">SEO</h3>

         <br>

         <p>So, you have your conversion-oriented website. It looks great and you're confident you're going to get more clients now.</p>

         <br>

         <p>You could stop here and you really would be in a <b>much</b> better position than you were in before.</p>

         <br>

         <p>When people visit your website, there's a really solid chance that they'll end up buying your service.</p>

         <br>

         <p>Great. I love my new website. But I'm not getting any traffic (nobody's visiting it). So, what now?</p>

         <br>

         <p>This is where SEO comes into play.</p>

         <br>

         <p>What is SEO?</p>

         <br>

         <p><a href="/growth-tips/counsellors-need-seo-services.html">SEO (Search Engine Optimisation)</a> is the process of ranking a website as high as possible on Google's or any other search engine's algorithms.</p>

         <br>

         <p>Why is this important?</p>

         <br>

         <p>Because if Google ranks your website high (if Google loves your website) then your website will be displayed on the front page of the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages).</p>

         <br>

         <p>For context, this is a SERP:</p>

         <br>

         <img src="/images/blog/google-results.jpg" alt="google-results" class="img-fluid">

         <br><br><br>

         <p>We've all seen this page when searching for something on Google.</p>

         <br>

         <p>We all know that we are much more likely to click on the links that are closest to the top (because we are lazy and this is more convenient).</p>

         <br>

         <p>So, when someone searches for something like 'online counselling', where would you like your business to appear? Near the top of page 1 on Google or somewhere on page 27?</p>

         <br>

         <p>I'd imagine and I'd hope you'd want your website to appear near the top of page 1.</p>

         <br>

         <p>This is essentially what SEO is, ranking your website as high as possible on Google's pages so that more people will come to visit you.</p>

         <br>

         <p>Of course, as a result, the more traffic you get, the more likely someone is going to buy what you're selling.</p>

         <br>

         <h3 id="social-media">Social Media Management</h3>

         <br>

         <p>Having a conversion-oriented website and SEO is a great start. You'll be well on your way to getting more people visiting your site and seeing how your services can improve their mental well-being.</p>

         <br>

         <p>As I said, this is a great start and the importance of this shouldn't be dismissed.</p>

         <br>

         <p>But with all the opportunity for exposure out there on the internet, why just focus on getting clients through Google? When almost all of your potential clients will be using social media as well?</p>

         <br>

         <p>That's where my social media management services come in.</p>

         <br>

         <p>If you already have social media accounts for your business, you'll no longer have to worry about what you post and how much content you post per week.</p>

         <br>

         <p>That worry will be taken completely away from you and placed onto me.</p>

         <br>

         <p>You can now focus on what you do best. Improving the mental well-being of people who need your help.</p>

         <br>

         <p>If you don't already have social media profiles from sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn. I'll create those accounts for you with the goal of building a loyal client base so that you have clients reaching out to you...</p>
         
         <br>
         
         <p>Not the other way around!</p>

         <h2 align="center">About Me</h2>

         <br>

         <div align="center">
          <img class="profile-pic img-fluid" src="/images/main/harrison-greeves-profile-photo.jpeg" alt="harrison-greeves-profile-photo">
        </div>

        <br>

        <p>You may be thinking I look a little too young to have had 10-15 years experience of working in the mental health industry before like some of my competitors (and you're right).</p>

        <br>

        <p>If so, you're probably wondering why I help counsellors and not any other demographic.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Due to my history of mental health issues and despising authority, I've had entrepreneurial ambitions of having an impact on this industry since being a teenager. I just never knew how I'd fulfil those ambitions.</p>

        <br>

        <p>I took a psychology-related degree at university partially because I wanted to help people who had gone through something similar to what I had.</p>

        <br>

        <p>The problem was, although I wanted to help, I never truly believed I had the required personality traits and the desire to sit down and discuss personal issues with another human being.</p>

        <br>

        <p>The other problem was, although I wanted to serve this industry, I realised I didn't have any form of academic interest in this field.</p>

        <br>

        <p>I was more interested in technology and business.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Fast-forward a few years and the world has been taken to a halt by a thing you may have heard of by now called COVID-19.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Now, like most people, I heard about mental health issues in the UK every so often from the media.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Knowing now that those issues would have exacerbated dramatically, surely the demand for mental health support is at its peak right now.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Like I mentioned before, I don't have the required personality traits (nor the credentials) to help people with mental health issues directly.</p>

        <br>

        <p>However, I do have the ability to the next best thing. I can help the people that help the people that I want to help. While making mental health services much more accessible online.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Therefore, in a way, helping the people that I want to help.</p>

        <br>

        <p>That was and <b>is</b> my motivation for starting Clients for Counsellors. Helping counsellors get clients by making their services more accessible online.</p>

        <br>

        <p>And as a by-product, helping people with mental health issues.</p>

        <br><br>

        <p>While I'm not doing all this stuff, I'm in Taiwan, learning Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and being a typical Brit by making a woeful effort to embrace the culture and learn Chinese. 🙃</p>
