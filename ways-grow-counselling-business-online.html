            <p>The following list of ways to grow your counselling business online may not be the quickest. However, they may be the most effective.</p>

            <br>

            <p>They can also be applied to any business that requires an online presence. Not just counselling businesses or businesses in the mental health industry.</p>
            
            <br>

            <p>Anyway, let's get right to it...</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h3 align="center">1. Have a Mobile-Friendly Website</h3>
            
            <br>

            <img src="blog_images/mobile-friendly.jpg" alt="mobile-friendly-website-counsellors" class="img-responsive">

            <br>
            
            <p>First things first, not having a mobile-friendly website is bad news in 2020. However, not even having a website is borderline unacceptable ;)</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Especially, for a business in the mental health industry where building trust between clients and prospects is absolutely paramount for success.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>If you're one of those sorry souls that still doesn't have a website, check out this article here to learn why you absolutely should.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>It now appears that over 54% of people browsing the internet are doing so through their mobile phones. So, what does this mean? It means that if your mobile website looks like this:</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Then, you're probably alienating over half of your prospects.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Having your website look like a magazine collage you made in year 4 is quite an extreme example. However, there are some more common examples of problems with mobile sites to be found here.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h3 align="center">2. Have a Strong Social Media Presence</h3>
            
            <br>

            <img src="blog_images/strong-social-media.jpg" alt="strong-social-media-presence-counsellors" class="img-responsive">

            <br>
            
            <p>Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter have all become the modern-day public squares, where, almost everyone spends the majority of their screen time. (Despite the downsides to their mental health!).</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>For that reason alone, creating a strong social media presence is a very necessary step to growing your counselling business online.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Having a strong social media presence means more than just having a few accounts set up and hoping for the best.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Building a targeted audience (people likely to be interested in your counselling service) and keeping them engaged is what leads to you getting clients through social media.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>How can this be done?</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>You need to post quality content - Post content that is relevant to your audience's interests. For example, as a counsellor, you should have a following that is interested in acquiring support for their mental health.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>So, post content that is relevant to that desire.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Posting something positive that is going to make their day a little bit better is a good idea. Here's a general example that could be included with some description by the author expanding on it:</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <img style="height: 450px; width: 100%;" src="blog_images/mental_health_quote.jpg" alt="mental-health-quote-inspiration" class="img-responsive">
            
            <br>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Making posts that aren't relevant to your niche probably isn't going to win you many fans. Doing so consistently would probably just irritate your followers.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Some people like to get political on social media which is fine. But do it on your personal profiles. Not on your business pages where you're trying to get clients.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Posting political content on LinkedIn (a professional job and networking site) is a trend I've noticed recently. If you're using LinkedIn for getting clients (which you should be!), then posting and commenting on content like this probably isn't going to help you:</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <img src="blog_images/political-meme.jpg" alt="political-meme-donald-trump-covid" class="img-responsive">
            
            <br>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Even if the intentions are light-hearted and humorous.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Content like this should be posted and commented on with your personal accounts, not your business accounts.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Consistency - This is also key. But don't overdo it.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Post three times a day and you're probably not going to get out what you put in. Most of your following don't have the time or the desire to engage with that many posts per day.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Post once a month and you're likely going to have a difficult time keeping your audience interested. They may even forget you exist.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Personally, I think two quality posts (e.g. Monday and Thursday) a week is a happy medium.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h3 align="center">3. Have a Website with SEO</h3>
            
            <br>

            <img src="blog_images/seo.jpg" alt="seo-website-counsellors" class="img-responsive">

            <br>
            
            <p>SEO (Search Engine Optimisation), in layman's terms, is pretty much the process of getting your website ranked high on Google's search algorithms (or any other search engine).</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Why is this important?</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Because the higher ranked your website is in Google's search algorithms, the easier Google will make it for users to find your website. Leading to more prospects visiting your website.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>For example, when a user searches through Google with the following key words:</p>
            
            <br>

            <img src="blog_images/keyword-search.jpg" alt="keyword-search-counsellor-brighton-google" class="img-responsive">

            <br>
            
            <p>and assuming you're a counsellor that is based in Brighton and specialises in helping people with anxiety, you're going to want your website to appear first when you scroll down through the results. Like these sites:</p>
            
            <br>

            <img src="blog_images/google-results.jpg" alt="google-results-counsellor-brighton" class="img-responsive">

            <br>
            
            <p>Evidently, these are websites with 'good' SEO. Or at least, they have better SEO than the websites of their competitors that show up after they do.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>The majority of people searching for these terms don't want to waste too much time and they're most likely going to visit these websites.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Not your website that is located all the way on page 50 of Google.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>This is why an SEO optimised website is crucial for growing your counselling business online.</p>
            
            <br>

            <br>
            
            <p>There are many ways to improve your SEO. Some ways are easier than others. Here are 10 simple ways you can gain some 'quick wins' for your website's SEO.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <h3 align="center">4. Have a Fast Website</h3>
            
            <br>

            <img src="blog_images/fast-website.jpg" alt="fast-website-counsellors" class="img-responsive">

            <br>
            
            <p>OK, 'fast' is obviously a subjective term.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>So, for some context. Here are a few a website-loading cases that truly represent the impatience of people on the internet today:</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Up to 53% of people using mobile devices give up on a website that takes over 3 seconds to load.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Another study showed that 50% of internet users want a website to load in 2 seconds or less. Regardless of the device they're using. If the website takes over 2 seconds to load, they'll move on to something else.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Amazon found that 100 milliseconds of latency costed them 1% of their entire sales revenue.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>(This was back in 2009 where people probably hadn't even developed the level of impatience that people exhibit today!).</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>1% of sales lost for a small counselling business isn't likely to be a problem.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>But remember, this is to provide context.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Think about how much Amazon must have been worth (even 10 years ago), and how much money 1% of their revenue is.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Yet, they still lost all that money for every time the user had to wait an extra tenth of a second for the website to load!</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>The point here is, if your website doesn't load fast enough, you're losing sales. Full stop.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>You're not only losing sales because of humanity's impatience&hellip;</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Not even Google can spare an extra few milliseconds to wait for your website to load!</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Slow loading time for websites is also bad for ranking higher on Google.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>If Google's algorithms don't believe your website is loading quickly enough, your SEO score will be negatively affected and they will rank you lower as a result.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Before you take any form of action on improving your website's loading speed, you should test how quickly your website loads with&nbsp;</span><a href="https://gtmetrix.com/">https://gtmetrix.com/</a>.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>If you're wondering how you can improve your website's loading speed. You should probably hire a specialist as the necessary changes to be made do require technical skill.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Regardless, if you're interested, click here.</p>
