          <p class="date"><b>4. Sep, 2020</b></p>
          
          <br>

          <p>The year 2020 has been a challenging one, to say the least. Particularly, in the UK. With Brexit and COVID-19 combining forces to ensure that this year is one that will be especially difficult to overcome for people suffering from mental illnesses.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>I have no hard evidence <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic">here</a> but it seems that cases would have only surged since the outbreak started. Additionally, cases that already were, would have likely been exacerbated further.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>If there really has been a huge increase in mental illness cases recently. Then that can only mean, demand for mental health support is very high. Maybe higher now than for a long time.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>However, a higher demand can only be met with a higher supply. Even if there are enough mental health specialists out there. A huge chunk of them still don't even have a website in 2020 (trust me, I know, I've looked around).</p>
          
          <br> 
            
          <p>The first place people will look for help is on the internet. If you're not there, your potential client base doesn't know you exist. So, how can you help?</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Whether you're a counsellor, psychiatrist, or hypnotherapist. Every mental health specialist should have a website in 2020.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h3 align="center"><strong>1. Being There</strong></h3>
          
          <br>
              
          <img src="../images/blog//standing-meditation-min.jpg" alt="standing-meditation" class="img-fluid">
          
          <br><br>

          <p>Whether, you as a mental health specialist, consider your service as an independent business or not, does not entirely matter. The fact is, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/digital/81-shoppers-conduct-online-research-making-purchase-infographic/">81% of people research a product or service online before making a purchasing decision.</a></p>
          
          <br>

          <p>If you’re not online and your competitors are, can you really expect to win the client the majority of the time?</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Unlikely.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>By having a website, you’re not only ‘just there’, but you’re there every day, 7 days a week. Having a website is almost like having your own agent.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Except this robot agent doesn't eat, drink, or sleep.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Pretty handy right?</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>When you’re sleeping, your website is still there, warming up and generating leads. When you’re spending time with your family, your website will still be there. Even when you’re on a two week holiday in Spain, your website will still be working for you.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>This point alone should be enough of a reason for you to get serious about having a website. But lets continue...</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h3 align="center"><strong>2. Ensure Trust and Professionalism</strong></h3>
          
          <br>
                
          <img src="../images/blog//handshake-min.jpg" alt="handshake" class="img-fluid">
          
          <br><br>

          <p>I hate to be the one to break it to you (no I don't), you need a website to be taken seriously by potential clients and rightfully so.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>In fact, <a href="https://www.verisign.com/assets/Research-small-business-september2013.pdf?inc=www.verisigninc.com">56% of people stated that they don’t trust a business without a website.</a></p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Are you genuinely content with over half of the population not trusting your business/service?</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>I wouldn't be.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>In the year 2020, an overwhelming majority of business is done on the internet. If you’re not on there by now, are you really taking your business/service seriously?</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>If the answer is no. Then, why should anybody else?</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>They shouldn’t.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Having a website, shows you care. It shows you care about your business/service enough to go out and make your service be known to the general public.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>And if people notice that you care, then you become a lot easier to trust.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h3 align="center"><strong>3. Save Time</strong></h3>
          
          <br>

          <img src="../images/blog/hour-glass-min.jpg" alt="hour-glass" class="img-fluid">
          
          <br><br>

          <p>Many small business owners (without a website) give off the impression that having a website consumes more time than not having one.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>On the contrary. Having a website is a huuuge time saver.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>It simply requires a time investment upfront.</p>
          
          <br>  

          <p>An effective website allows you to have sections specifically designed for saving time. Such as, a testimonial and FAQ section.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>As I alluded to earlier, merely having a website ensures more trust than not having a website. But having a testimonial section where former clients are telling the world how great you are?</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>That'll win you a serious amount of trust points with people on the fence about purchasing your service.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Ensuring trust with a testimonial actually saves you a lot of time because it allows you to avoid endless questions from people unsure about your service. Because former clients have already answered those questions for them.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>An FAQ section would have a similar effect. Except that you, yourself, would be answering frequently asked questions. Clearing any room for doubt that’s clogging the way between your potential client's scepticism and he/she purchasing your service.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>A blog on your website is also a good way to answer questions and clarify any misconceptions about your service.</p>
