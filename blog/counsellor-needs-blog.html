          <p class="date"><b>17. Nov, 2020</b></p>
          
          <br>

          <p>If you're a counsellor and you have a website (which you should), then you should also have a blog page on that website.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>After analysing various websites of mental health specialists, it's surprising to see how many of them don't include a blog page.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Clearly, having a blog is undervalued. However, it shouldn't be, because there are many benefits to having one. So much in fact, that, having a blog is one of the main reasons why you should have a website. </p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Here are 5 reasons why counsellors (or any mental health specialist) should have a blog on their website:</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h2 align="center"><strong>1. Show Off Your Expertise</strong></h2>
          
          <br>
              
          <img src="../images/blog/highlighter-expertise.jpg" alt="highlighter-expertise" class="img-fluid">
          
          <br><br>

          <p>Having a blog is a free and simple way to demonstrate to prospects that you know what you're talking about.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Perhaps, potential clients are scrolling through your website and they're not completely convinced that you are the most qualified person to be helping them with whatever troubles they may be having.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>But, they see your blog, they read your articles and realise that you have, not only experience, but free advice too.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>This is the process of qualifying yourself to your prospects.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>What do I mean by qualifying? I'm referring to the process of gaining trust from a complete stranger.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>They go from not knowing or caring who you are to not only knowing what you provide but respecting and desiring it.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Merely having people notice that there is a blog on your website will enable you to build trust with them.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Even if they don't read any of your articles but they see the title and display image of one of your articles, they are more likely to perceive you as an expert. </p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h2 align="center"><strong>2. Have More Social Media Content</strong></h2>
          
          <br>
                
          <img src="../images/blog/social-media.jpg" alt="social-media" class="img-fluid">
          
          <br><br>

          <p>Are you struggling to keep your social media posts not only consistent but valuable to your followers?</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>When you have a blog, every post that is on your website can and should be shared to your social media profiles.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>This will not only allow new people to see your content but it will bring more traffic to your website, which will increase your ranking in Google.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Even more so, if your posts are valuable, your followers may share them across their pages and you can gain more website visitors and social media followers that way too.</p>
          
          <br>

          <h2>3. Learn More About Your Target Market</h2>

          <br>

          <img src="../images/blog/target-audience.jpg" alt="target-audience" class="img-fluid">

          <br><br>

          <p>Blogs can also be used as a fishing net for information on your potential clients.</p>

          <br>

          <p>What do I mean by that?</p>

          <br>

          <p>One way to utilise this fishing net is to harness analytics software on your website (e.g. Google Analytics).</p>

          <br>

          <p>Analytics software allows you to track your user demographics. This becomes very useful when trying to identify which articles on your site are being visited the most, how long a user stays on a particular page for,  and through which medium a user finds your site (a search engine, social media, etc.).</p>

          <br>

          <p>For example, say if you're a counsellor that offers multiple services of counselling. One of those services is counselling for people with anorexia. Another is for people with depression.</p>

          <br>

          <p>You also have two articles. One called "Dealing with Anorexia" and one called "Dealing with Depression".</p>

          <br>

          <p>(I understand this may be an oversimplification but hear me out).</p>

          <br>

          <p>"Dealing with Anorexia" consistently gains more traffic and a higher session duration than "Dealing with Depression".</p>

          <br>

          <p>What does that tell you about your users?</p>

          <br>

          <p>Are they more likely to require your counselling for anorexia or your counselling for depression?</p>

          <br>

          <p>Obviously, anorexia.</p>

          <br>

          <p>At that point, it may be time to start revising your current marketing strategy. Ideally, you'd want to begin marketing in a way that caters more towards people struggling with anorexia than people with depression.</p>

          <br>

          <p>The same can be said about social media.</p>

          <br>

          <p>If you find out that everyone is visiting your site through LinkedIn but nobody is visiting your site through Facebook. Then, perhaps building a stronger presence on Facebook is a solution to gaining more traffic and clients.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Comment sections can also be included on your blog so you can get explicit feedback from your users.</p>

          <br>

          <p>The same principle applies, if one of your articles is gaining a lot more positive comments than another. Then, perhaps you've gained more insight into what the average member of your target market is looking for.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <h2 align="center"><strong>4. Increase Your Ranking on Google</strong></h2>
          
          <br>

          <img src="../images/blog/increase-ranking-google.jpg" alt="increase-ranking-google" class="img-fluid">
          
          <br><br>

          <p>One of the most commonly known benefits of having a blog on your website is <a href="online-counsellors-need-seo-services.html">SEO (Search Engine Optimisation).</a></p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>The better your SEO, the higher your ranking will be on Google. The higher your ranking is on Google, the more likely people are to visit your website.</p>
          
          <br>
          
          <p>(Your ranking will improve on other search engines as well, not just Google).</p>
          
          <br>  

          <p><a href="https://www.semrush.com/blog/10-seo-quick-wins-to-drive-rapid-rankings-improvement/">There are many ways to improve your SEO</a>, but having a blog is one of the most commonly known.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>As long as your content is relevant to your counselling services and mental health, people searching for relevant terms are more likely to stumble upon your blog posts and your website.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>Which, in turn, will increase your website traffic and your SEO as a result.</p>
          
          <br>

          <p>What a lovely snowball effect.</p>
          
          <br>

          <h2 align="center"><strong>5. Reveal Your Personality and Counselling Style</strong></h2>
          
          <br>

          <img src="../images/blog/personality-counselling-style.jpg" alt="personality-counselling-style" class="img-fluid">

          <br><br>

          <p>This is a huge advantage for any mental health specialist.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Blogging allows you enough room to really form a connection with potential and current clients.</p>

          <br>

          <p>It gives you the opportunity to let the user know who you are and what kind of counselling they are to expect if they book your service(s).</p>

          <br>

          <p>I see a lot of mental health specialists trying to do this on the front page of their website.</p>

          <br>

          <p>They go into heaps and heaps of detail about their experience and counselling style which leaves a huge mess of writing on their front page (their sales page!).</p>

          <br>

          <p>The fact that they try to do this is not a bad thing. The problem is, this negatively impacts the design of the website and their marketability (I'll talk about this more in a future post).</p>

          <br>

          <p>A blog allows you to have a designated area on your website where you can really go into detail about this stuff.</p>
